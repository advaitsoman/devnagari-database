In handwritten character recognition, benchmark database plays an important role for evaluating the performance of various algorithms and the results obtained by various researchers. In Devnagari script there is lack of such official benchmark. This article focuses on the generation of offline benchmark database for Devnagari handwritten numerals and characters. The present work generated 5137 and 20305 isolated samples for numeral and character database respectively from 750 writers of all ages, sex, education and profession. The off-line sample images are stored in TIFF image format as it occupies less memory. Also the data is presented in binary level so that memory requirement is further reduced. It will facilitate research on handwriting recognition of Devnagari script through free access to the researchers.
